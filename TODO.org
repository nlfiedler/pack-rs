* Action Items
** TODO find a file by its path and print it
*** see =Result= in =IndexedItemsSQLite3SQLStatement= in =UPackDraft0Shared.pas= in Pack
** TODO extract all files from the archive, creating directories as needed
*** consider how this can be done quickly and efficiently
*** create a zero-length file on restore if the item has no =itemcontent= rows
*** unix: ignore the leading =/= or =..= for absolute paths
*** windows: ignore leading drive letter specifier
** TODO size content bundles dynamically
*** based on the number of incoming files
*** will need to experiment with different data sets to find appropriate sizes
** TODO process content bundles concurrently
*** determine if SQLite is thread-safe and how to use =rusqlite= concurrently
**** SQLite can be thread-safe in ~multi-thread~ or ~serialized~ modes
**** =rusqlite= will ensure SQLite is in thread-safe mode
*** each thread needs to have its own =Connection= instance
*** build a queue of content bundles by scanning file tree and producing sets of content bundle parameters
*** threads take parameters, read files, combine into a bundle, compress, insert ~content~ and ~itemcontent~ rows
** TODO set database page size according to size of input set
*** if more than =1mb=, page size is =4096=, otherwise =512=
*** add a =new_with_page_size()= function or similar
** TODO unpack the archive using concurrent threads
** TODO consider optionally compressing the content bundles
*** if compression does not make the bundle smaller, then store as-is
*** add column to =content= table that indicates if the blob is compressed or not
**** the =zstd= API lacks a means of detecting if data is compressed or not
** TODO validate the pack file when opening
** TODO add a file to an existing archive
*** should look up the full path and ensure parents exist
*** if an existing entry matches the full path, create a new ~content~ row and replace its ~itemcontent~ rows
**** that is, leave any existing ~content~ row alone (it may contain other files)
**** add a new ~content~ row for this new file
**** remove any ~itemcontent~ rows for this particular item
**** add new ~itemcontent~ rows for this new file
** TODO remove a file from an existing archive
** TODO support includes/excludes when building archive
** TODO support includes/excludes when extracting archive
** TODO optionally store file times, owners, permissions in separate table
*** ~attrs~ table
| column | type    | description                 |

| item   | integer | foreign key to ~item~ table |

*** SQLite supports date/time with multiple storage classes and related functions
**** use the =INTEGER= storage class and store as Unix time
** TODO optionally store extended attributes in separate table
*** ~xattrs~ table

| item   | integer | foreign key to ~item~ table |
| name   | text    | name of extended attribute  |
| value  | blob    | extended attribute bytes    |
** library development plan
*** enable creating the database in memory for unit testing purposes
