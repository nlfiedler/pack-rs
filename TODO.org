* Action Items
** TODO pack the archive concurrently
*** currently not making any use of multiple cores
*** previous attempt showed some improvement, but the threadpool was buggy
** TODO unpack the archive concurrently
*** if total file size is known in advance, could use fallocate
**** c.f. https://gist.github.com/jdidion/3e47a83a0047f4291c1beb2f3a179a3f
*** otherwise, can wrap =File= in an =Arc<Mutex>= and manage using that
** TODO improve error handling
*** avoid the generic ~No such file or directory~ error
*** specifying files/folders that do not exist
*** specifying =pack= to list/extract when =pack.db3= exists should use that name
** TODO size content bundles dynamically
*** based on the number of incoming files (is what Pack does)
*** will need to experiment with different data sets to find appropriate sizes
** TODO set database page size according to size of input set
*** if more than =1mb=, page size is =4096=, otherwise =512= (is what Pack does)
*** add a =new_with_page_size()= function or similar
*** will need to experiment with different data sets to find appropriate sizes
** TODO consider optionally compressing the content bundles
*** if compression does not make the bundle smaller, then store as-is
*** add column to =content= table that indicates the compression algorithm, or =none=
**** the =zstd= crate lacks an API for detecting if data is compressed or not
**** having an algorithm label allows for different compression algorithms
** TODO add files to an existing archive
*** should look up the full path and ensure parents exist
*** if an existing entry matches the full path, create a new ~content~ row and replace its ~itemcontent~ rows
**** that is, leave any existing ~content~ row alone (it may contain other files)
**** add a new ~content~ row for this new file
**** remove any ~itemcontent~ rows for this particular item
**** add new ~itemcontent~ rows for this new file
** TODO remove files from an existing archive
** TODO consider how to encrypt file data and metadata
** TODO support includes/excludes when building archive
** TODO support includes/excludes when extracting archive
** TODO optionally store file times, owners, permissions in separate table
*** ~attrs~ table
| column | type    | description                 |
|--------+---------+-----------------------------|
| item   | integer | foreign key to ~item~ table |
| mode   | integer | Unix file mode              |
| attrs  | integer | Windows file attributes     |
| mtime  | integer | modified time               |
| ctime  | integer | creation time               |
| atime  | integer | accessed time               |
| user   | text    | user name                   |
| uid    | integer | user identifier             |
| group  | text    | group name                  |
| gid    | integer | group identifier            |
*** SQLite supports date/time with multiple storage classes and related functions
**** use the =INTEGER= storage class and store as Unix time
** TODO optionally store extended attributes in separate table
*** ~xattrs~ table
| column | type    | description                 |
|--------+---------+-----------------------------|
| item   | integer | foreign key to ~item~ table |
| name   | text    | name of extended attribute  |
| value  | blob    | extended attribute bytes    |
** library development plan
*** error reporting from task threads needs to percolate upward
*** enable creating the database in memory for unit testing purposes
*** test cases
- empty files
- empty directories
- files larger than blob size
